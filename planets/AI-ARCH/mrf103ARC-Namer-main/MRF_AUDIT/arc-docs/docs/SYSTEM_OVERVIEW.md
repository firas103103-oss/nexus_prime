# System Overview: ARC

The ARC system architecture is designed to integrate and manage a wide variety of functionalities in a unified platform. It is structured to optimize scalability, modularity, and performance while ensuring maintainability and ease of integration. 

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Scalability:** The architecture supports horizontal and vertical scaling to accommodate varying workloads and resources.
2. **Modularity:** ARC is built using a modular design, allowing components to be independently modified, replaced, or upgraded without impacting the entire system.
3. **Interoperability:** The architecture promotes seamless interaction between different components and external systems.
4. **Data Management:** ARC implements robust data handling and governance mechanisms.
5. **Resilience:** The system is equipped with fault-tolerant features to ensure reliability and continuous operation.

This high-level overview focuses on the foundational principles that guide the design and development of ARC, steering clear of implementation-specific details.
