1. Theological Insulation: The disclaimer is strong, but the text constantly walks the fine line of 'Batinism' (Esoteric heresy). To protect the Organization and the author, insert periodic 'grounding' reminders that these spiritual states complement, not replace, physical religious obligations. 2. Terminological Longevity: The reliance on the term 'The Matrix' risks dating the book. Suggest using 'The Construct' or 'The Illusory Web' to ensure timelessness. 3. Psychological Safety: The chapters on 'Fana' (Annihilation) and 'Death Meditation' are intense. Add a distinct advisory note regarding psychological stability before these specific exercises to mitigate liability. 4. Structural Cohesion: The transition between 'Greek Logos' and 'Islamic Wahy' needs a smoother bridge; currently, it feels like a jump in frequency. Use the concept of 'Universal Truth' to bind them tighter.
