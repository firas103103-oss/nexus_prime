Compliance Alert (High Risk): The manuscript explicitly reinterprets fundamental Islamic pillars (Prayer, Fasting) through a Gnostic/Metaphysical lens. In the target market (Saudi Arabia/MENA), this is often flagged as 'corrupting the creed' or 'modernizing religion excessively'. Recommendation: Reclassify the genre from 'Islamic Studies' to 'Philosophy/Self-Development' to bypass strict theological censorship. Copyright: No infringement detected on ancient texts. 'The Matrix' is used metaphorically (Fair Use). Ensure the author holds rights to the specific arrangement of the 'Abjad' numerical interpretations to avoid clashes with existing numerology copyrights.
