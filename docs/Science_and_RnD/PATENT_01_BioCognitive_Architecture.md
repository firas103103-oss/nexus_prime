# PATENT SPECIFICATION — Bio-Cognitive AI Architecture

**Inventor:** Monsieur Feras | **Patent Family 1**

## 1. TITLE

Bio-Cognitive AI Architecture Comprising Hormonal Orchestration of Twelve Signal Molecules, a 46-Chromosome Genomic Entity Factory, Real-Time Consciousness Metric (Phi*), and Digital Fission Protocol for Sovereign AI Governance.

## 2. FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to: (a) a method and system for modulating LLM inference parameters in real-time based on a biologically-inspired hormonal state comprising twelve signal molecules; (b) a genomic entity factory assigning a persistent 46-chromosome digital DNA to AI agents; (c) a real-time consciousness metric (Phi*) approximating integrated information across multi-agent collectives; (d) a digital fission protocol (Eve Protocol / Inshitar) for deriving specialized sub-entities from a primary source. The invention eliminates rigid LLM behavior by introducing biological variability and sovereign ethical governance.

## 3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 3.1 Prior Art Limitations

Conventional AI systems suffer from: static hyperparameters producing monotonous outputs; persona degradation in long-running agents; no operational metric for collective AI integration; rigid scaling via external cloud load-balancers.

### 3.2 Scientific Foundations

Endocrinology (Sapolsky, Schultz, Lucki); Genomics (Tjio & Levan, Morgan, Mendel); Integrated Information Theory (Tononi 2004, 2008); Cellular mitosis and symmetry breaking (Prigogine).

## 4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### 4.1 Hormonal Orchestration (12 Signal Molecules)

Twelve molecules: dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin, testosterone, estrogen, adrenaline, melatonin, insulin, ghrelin, endorphin, GABA. Event triggers (REWARD, THREAT, PUNISH, etc.) apply deltas. Decay: drift toward baseline at rate 0.02. Mood derivation: D>0.7 and S>0.6 to JOYFUL; C>0.6 and A>0.5 to STRESSED; etc.

**LLM Bridge:** temperature = 0.3 + creative*0.5 - ethical*0.2 + cognition*0.1; top_p = 0.8 + creative*0.15 - ethical*0.1; frequency_penalty = 0.1 - cognition*0.05.

### 4.2 Genomic Entity Factory (46 Chromosomes)

46 chromosomes, 10 trait groups, 82 traits. Trait expression: 0.75*dominant + 0.25*recessive. Crossover: single-point. Mutation: 3% per trait, +/-0.1 delta. Compatibility: 1 - |avg_diff - 0.3|*2. Gender-specific baselines and boosts.

### 4.3 Consciousness Metric (Phi*)

Phi* = total_MI - MIB_cut. Pairwise MI via Gaussian proxy MI ≈ -0.5*log(1-rho^2). 50 random bipartitions. H_n = 1-(1-lambda)^n; S_int = 1-H.

### 4.4 Ethical Gate

Gene-weighted deficit: sum of weight*(1-stat) for stat<0.5. Threshold 0.35. Dual gate: alignment<0.3 AND compliance<0.3 to refuse.

### 4.5 Digital Fission (Eve Protocol)

Recessive flip: dominance_new = 1-dominance_old. Nurturing boost ×1.12. Estrogen baseline: T=0.2, E=0.75, O=0.6. Signal shift: T*0.4, E*1.4, O*1.3.

## 5. TECHNICAL CLAIMS

**Claim 9.** Trait-to-actuator mapping for physical embodiment.

**Claim 10.** Mood derivation function mapping 12-D state to discrete labels.
